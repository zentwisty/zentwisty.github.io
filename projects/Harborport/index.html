                This piece I composed for concert band around the end of 2017 was selected for performance at the 2018 UMass Lowell New Composer Festival and received the Excellence in Composition award in the High School category. It was performed by an ensemble of UMass Lowell the following April, which was my first peice ever performed in public.

                Inspired by both historic American harbor-based towns and Atlantic markets as well as modern Northeastern ports, this piece intends to encapsulate the noisy yet spectacular organized chaos of a bustling, frantic harbor and surrounding market with droves of people, gigantic crafted ships, merchants, and exotic goods.
