                This short film was created by Catherine Hackl, Ella Peterson, Ivery Chen, Sarah Jihyun Woo, and me as our final project for CSCI 1250: Intro to 3D Animation.

                As our first step in the production pipeline, my project partners and I collaboratively created a storyboard outlining what the plot of the story should be and what scenes and shots we'll need to tell that story. From there, we divided up tasks to be done in Maya.

                My biggest contributions to the project were modelling props, blocking out camera movement, and animating the characters in my designated scenes. I also worked extensively with debugging our interactions with the renderfarm.

                I composed an entirely original score for the film using Musescore. I used Audacity to create original sound effects by remixing sounds taken from free online sources, then aligned them with the events of the film and mixed in the score on top.
