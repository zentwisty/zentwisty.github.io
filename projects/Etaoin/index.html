                For my final project for MUSC 1210: Real-Time Systems, I created a project using Max/MSP/Jitter that the
                26 letters of the alphabet as input and converts them into a chord sequence and a melody. This project was finished on June 25, 2022.

        <div class="section composing">
            <h1>

            </h1>
            <p>
                The next chord in the sequence is generated in realtime based on how likely the next typed letter is to
                follow the previous letter (<a
                    href="http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~leon/mcs425-s08/handouts/char_freq2.pdf">here's the data I used
                    to calculate that</a>).
                The melody is generated on top of the chords based on how frequently that letter is used in English
                overall (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency">and here's the data for that</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                I associated each of the relative frequencies between pairs of letters with chord movements that were equally as
                common or uncommon. I used my music theory knowledge (as well as personal preference) to order chord
                movements on how common/sonorous I thought they were, while also limiting the chords to only major and
                minor triads for simplicity.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if we are currently on a major triad, the 1st most common
                movement is to another major triad a perfect 4th away, the 2nd most common movement is to another major
                triad a perfect 5th away, etc. and then I also specified a separate list if our current chord is a minor triad. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With 12 possible intervals to move between and the next chords being able to be major or minor, we had 24
                different options, which was just 2 short of the 26 we need to account for every letter combination, so
                I made it so that the 25th and 26th most common options map to a random frequency move (within an
                octave) in the root, and the two options are whether they are major or minor. 
                (Also note that if a
                letter combination does not exist, like xg, jq, vh, those will automatically be mapped to the least
                common chord movement option, thus their movement is always random.) 
            </p>
            <p>
                I followed a very similar process to calculate the melody. The difference is that the melody note
                considers the root note and the quality of the chord, then just chooses an interval above it, which
                gives us 12 intervals + 1 random, so I just had 2 letters each map to the same interval (E and T map to
                the root, A and O map to a perfect 5th, ... Q and Z map to random frequencies).

                This project was created as an interactive Max patch. I followed my specifications for the chord and melody movement mentioned above, encoding it using Max/MSP/Jitter.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also took the data from the sources linked above, and I processed it because I couldn't just use the percent frequency given;
                I needed their relative frequencies to each other (i.e. following W for example, A is the 1st most
                common, H is the 2nd most common, etc). I did this by writing a python script to read in .csv
                files.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd like to point out that for the actual sound production, because I was using frequencies instead of pitches, I was able to
                implement just intonation of the chords, which I think made it sound a bit nicer. I also decided to
                use a piano sample to play the chords.
