                This is an innovative two-player competitive rhythm game created by the Brown-RISD Game Developers in the fall of 2021. <a href="https://brownrisdgames.itch.io/boogie-brawl">Click here to play for yourself</a>!

                As the first stage of the development process, the entire team comes together to work as designers and determine the mechanics we want to center the game around. We decided our core mechanic was going to be that each player sets the rhythm that their opponent must match by pressing the keys to the beat of the music, and at the same time they have to defend from their opponents attacks in the same way.

                As the lead sound designer for this project, I lead a team of people to create 4 tracks colloratively that provided the players with multiple difficulty options (mainly through lower or higher BPMs) and also sounded cohesive instrumentation-wise and matched with the disco visual aesthetic.

                Using Unity and C#, I implemented the dynamic changes of the melodies based on whether the left or the right player is winning so that the volume of the player's melody is proportional to the amount of points that player has.
