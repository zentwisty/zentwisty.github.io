                I wrote this piece when my high school wind ensemble director graciously gave me the opportunity to compose something original to be played at the following fall concert. As it was only my second piece ever performed in public, so during the months the ensemble rehearsed the piece, I recieved feedback and made revisions as part of my learning process.

                In addition to meaning "angry", the word "livid" refers to a blue-gray color. This is an allusion to the blue-gray storm clouds and crashing waves along the Cliff Walk in Newport, Rhode Island. The piece follows the path of the Cliff Walk alongside the sea, over rocks, and through tunnels while tempestuous, blustery winds blow and heavy rain falls. The constant motion represents the relentless fluttering of the wind, and the ominous, stagnant sections represent the vastness of the ocean and its undulating tides, swelling slowly yet forcefully.
